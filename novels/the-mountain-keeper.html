                        <p>
                            For three hundred years, the mountain has had its keeper. When young Kira's grandfather, 
                            the current keeper, falls mysteriously ill, she must ascend the sacred peak to take on 
                            his mantle—a duty she never wanted and a destiny she doesn't understand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The mountain is alive in ways the modern world has forgotten. Ancient spirits dwell in 
                            its caves, mystical creatures protect its forests, and deep within its heart lies a 
                            power that could reshape the world—or destroy it. As the new keeper, Kira must learn 
                            to communicate with the mountain's consciousness, maintain the delicate balance between 
                            the magical and mundane realms, and protect the secrets that have been guarded for millennia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But dark forces have learned of the mountain's power. A corrupt corporation seeks to 
                            exploit its resources, unaware of the catastrophic consequences. A rogue sorcerer wants 
                            to claim its magic for himself. And somewhere in the mountain's depths, an ancient evil 
                            is stirring—something that the keepers have held at bay for centuries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kira must master her newfound abilities, unite fractured communities, and make impossible 
                            choices to preserve not just the mountain, but the very fabric of reality itself. The 
                            question is: can a reluctant keeper find the strength to stand against forces that have 
                            been plotting for decades?
                        </p>

                        <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 15px;">Chapter 1: The Calling</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Kira woke to the sound of wind chimes—strange, because there were no wind chimes in her 
                            apartment. The melody was haunting, ancient, and seemed to come from everywhere and 
                            nowhere at once. She sat up in bed, her heart racing, and that's when she saw it: through 
                            her window, the mountain glowed with an ethereal blue light.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Her phone buzzed. A message from her mother: "Grandfather collapsed. Hospital. Come now."
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Kira dressed quickly, but as she grabbed her keys, the wind chimes grew louder. A voice, 
                            deep and resonant like the earth itself, spoke in her mind: "The mountain calls. The keeper 
                            falls. The cycle must continue."
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            She had always known, in the way children know things they're too young to question, that 
                            her grandfather was different. The village called him the Mountain Keeper, though she'd 
                            always thought it was just a title of respect, a tradition from older times. She never 
                            imagined it was literally true.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            As she drove toward the hospital, the mountain loomed in her rearview mirror, its peak 
                            wreathed in unnatural mist. And she could feel it—a pull, like invisible threads connecting 
                            her to ancient stone and eternal forests. The mountain was calling, and somehow, she knew 
                            her life would never be the same.
                        </p>
