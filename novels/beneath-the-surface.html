                        <p>
                            Four strangers, brought together by chance at a therapist's retreat in a remote coastal 
                            town, each harbor secrets that threaten to destroy their carefully constructed lives. 
                            What begins as a weekend of healing and self-discovery becomes a psychological maze where 
                            nothing is as it seems, and everyone's past is connected in ways they never imagined.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sarah, a successful architect, projects an image of having it all together, but beneath 
                            her composed exterior lies a devastating loss she's never dealt with. Marcus, a charismatic 
                            business consultant, charms everyone he meets while hiding a addiction that's spiraling 
                            out of control. Emma, a quiet artist, seems lost in her own world, but she's observing 
                            everything and everyone, hiding a past that connects her to all of them. And Dr. James 
                            Thornton, the therapist leading the retreat, has his own reasons for bringing these 
                            particular people together.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the weekend progresses and therapy sessions peel back layers of denial and deception, 
                            relationships form and shatter, alliances shift, and each person must confront not only 
                            their own demons but also the ways they've hurt others. When a violent storm isolates 
                            them from the outside world, the psychological tension reaches a breaking point.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, everyone must decide: continue living beneath the surface, or risk everything 
                            to finally be seen for who they really are. But the truth comes at a price, and some 
                            secrets should never be revealed.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The coastal road wound through fog so thick Sarah could barely see ten feet ahead. Her 
                            GPS claimed she was only minutes from the Seacliff Wellness Retreat, but in the gray 
                            murk, every turn looked the same. She gripped the steering wheel tighter, wondering 
                            for the hundredth time why she'd agreed to this.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            "A weekend away will do you good," her sister had insisted. "You've been working yourself 
                            to death since David..." She'd trailed off, the unfinished sentence hanging between them 
                            like it always did. Since David died. That's what she meant. But no one ever said it 
                            directly, as if avoiding the words could soften the reality.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The retreat center emerged from the fog like a ship at sea—a sprawling Victorian mansion 
                            perched on the cliffs, weathered but elegant. Sarah parked beside a sleek black Mercedes 
                            and a mud-splattered Jeep. At least she wouldn't be alone.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Inside, the reception area was warm and welcoming, all soft lighting and comfortable 
                            furniture. A man stood by the window, his back to her, phone pressed to his ear. "I told 
                            you, I'm unavailable this weekend," he said, his voice tight with barely controlled anger. 
                            "Handle it yourself." He ended the call and turned, his expression transforming instantly 
                            into a charming smile. "Hello there. Here for the retreat?"
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Sarah nodded, studying him. Designer clothes, expensive watch, the kind of confidence 
                            that came from always being in control. She'd met a hundred men like him in her career. 
                            But there was something else—a tension in his shoulders, a slight tremor in his hands 
                            as he pocketed his phone.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            "Marcus Chen," he said, extending his hand. "And you are?"
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Before she could answer, footsteps echoed in the hallway, and a woman appeared. Young, 
                            perhaps mid-twenties, with paint-stained jeans and an oversized sweater. She looked at 
                            both of them with an expression Sarah couldn't quite read—recognition? Fear? The moment 
                            passed so quickly, Sarah thought she might have imagined it.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            "Welcome," a new voice said. Dr. James Thornton stood in the doorway, older than his 
                            website photo suggested, with kind eyes and a knowing smile. "I'm so glad you all made it. 
                            This is going to be a very... revealing weekend."

                        <p>
                            <strong>Beneath the Surface</strong> is an intense psychological drama that explores the 
                            facades people create to protect themselves from pain and judgment. Through interwoven 
                            narratives and shifting perspectives, the story reveals how deeply connected we all are, 
                            and how the things we hide often bind us to others in unexpected ways.
